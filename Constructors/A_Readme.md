<h2>Constructor</h2>
> A Constructor is similar to methods.
> These are Special types of methods.
> Constructors are used to initialize the objects by setting initial values i.e, The constructors initialize them automatically when we call the class, there is no need for  calling constructors specially.
> The Constructors have Instance variables data which does not change frequently.
