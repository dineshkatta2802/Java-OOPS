<h1>⁡⁣⁢⁣Exception Handliing⁡</h1>
<h2>⁡⁣⁢⁣What are Java Exception⁡</h2>
An Exception is an unwanted and unexpected event that occurs during the compiling of code which disrupts the flow of the normal code<br>
Exception handling is one of the effective method to deal with runtime errors like ClassNotFoundException,IOException,SQLException etc..., so that the regular flow of the application is preversed<br>
When an exception occurs within a method it creates an object it is called exception object.<br>

<h2>⁡⁣⁢⁣Major reasons why an exception Occurs⁡</h2>
<ol>
<li>Invalid user input</li>
<li>Device failure</li>
<li>Loss of network connection</li>
<li>Physical limitations (out-of-disk memory)</li>
<li>Code errors</li>
<li>Opening an unavailable file</li>
</ol>

<h2>⁡⁣⁢⁣Difference between An Error and Exception⁡</h2>
<h3>⁡⁢⁣⁣Error:⁡</h3>
 An Error indicates a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
<h3>⁡⁢⁣⁣Exception:⁡</h3>
 Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.

<h3>⁡⁢⁣⁣Built-in Exception:⁡</h3>
These Exceptions are available in Java libraries these are suitable to explain certain exceptions<br>
The Built-in Exceptions are classified into 2 types-<br>
<ol>
<li>⁡⁢⁢⁢Chechked Exceptions⁡</li>
<ul>
<li>These Exceptiosna are also called as Compile-time Exceptiosn because these are found during the compile-time by the compiler</li>
<li>Checked Exceptionis furher divide into two types-</li>
<ul>
<li>Fullly Checked</li>
<li>Partially Checked</li></ul>
</ul>

<li>⁡⁢⁢⁢Unchecked Exceptions⁡</li>
<ul><li>It is opposite to the Checked Exceptions unlike checked exceptions they don't require to be fixed because they don't disrupt the program</li></ul>
</ol>
