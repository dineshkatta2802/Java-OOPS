<ol>

<li>Abstract Methods</li>
</ol><br>
<h2>Characteristics of Abstract Keyword</h2>
1.<u>Abstract class cannot be Instantiated directly</u> i.e cannot have object but it can operated 
by having the extended subclass<br>
2.<u>Abstract methods donot have body</u>,it is declared using abstract keyword and is ended by a 
Semicolon instead of method body and Subclasses of an abstract class must provide a concrete(normal)
implementation of all abstract methods that are defined in the parent class.<br>
3.<u>Abstract class can have both abstract methods as well as Concret(normal)methods</u>,the normal methods 
can be implemented in the abstarct class itself whereas the abstract methods cannot be implemented in 
the Abstract class<br>
4.<u>Abstract class can have Constructors</u>it also similar to that of the methods u need to instantiate them in sub class
5.<u>Abstract class can contain instance variables</u>,whih can be used by both abstract class and the sub class
6.<u>Abstract class can implement interface</u>
