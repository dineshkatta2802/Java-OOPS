<h2><u>Dynamic-polymorphism/Run-time Polymorphism</u></h2> <br>
This is achieved by Method Overriding.<br>
But Java doesn't support Operartor Overloading.<br>
ex:<br>
Method Overloading and method overriding using instance methods
<br>
<hr>
<h2><u>Static-Polyorphism/Compiletime Polymorpism</u></h2><br>
This isachieved by Method Overloadnga and Operator Overloading.<br>
ex:<br>
Method Overloading and method Overriding using static methods and method overloading using private and final methods
<br>
<hr>
Private methods cannot be overridden because they are not accessible to subclasses, but they can be overloaded within the same class since overloading is determined by method signature at compile time.
